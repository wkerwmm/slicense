## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

Please do **NOT** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

Instead, please report them via email to: **security@license-server.com**

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### What to Expect

After you submit a report, we will:

1. Confirm receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
2. Provide regular updates on our progress
3. Credit you in our security advisories (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT-based Authentication**: Stateless, secure token-based authentication
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Granular permission system with admin, manager, and user roles
- **Password Policies**: Enforced complexity requirements including minimum length, character types, and history
- **Account Lockout**: Protection against brute force attacks with configurable lockout duration
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with Redis-based storage

### Data Protection

- **Encryption at Rest**: Sensitive data encrypted using AES-256-GCM
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt with configurable cost factor
- **Data Anonymization**: PII protection capabilities for compliance
- **Secure Headers**: Comprehensive security-focused HTTP headers

### Input Validation & Sanitization

- **Request Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all incoming requests
- **SQL Injection Protection**: Parameterized queries only, no dynamic SQL
- **XSS Protection**: Content Security Policy and input sanitization
- **CSRF Protection**: Cross-site request forgery prevention
- **File Upload Security**: Restricted file types and size limits

### Network Security

- **Rate Limiting**: DDoS protection with configurable limits per IP
- **CORS Protection**: Configurable cross-origin resource sharing
- **IP Whitelisting**: Optional IP-based access control
- **Request Size Limits**: Protection against large payload attacks
- **Header Validation**: Suspicious header detection and blocking

### Monitoring & Auditing

- **Comprehensive Audit Logging**: All security events logged with structured data
- **Security Event Detection**: Automated detection of suspicious activities
- **Failed Login Tracking**: Monitoring and alerting on authentication failures
- **Access Pattern Analysis**: Detection of unusual access patterns
- **Real-time Alerts**: Immediate notification of security events

## Security Best Practices

### For Administrators

1. **Environment Variables**: Always use environment variables for sensitive configuration
2. **Regular Updates**: Keep the system and dependencies updated
3. **Access Control**: Implement least privilege access principles
4. **Monitoring**: Set up comprehensive monitoring and alerting
5. **Backup Security**: Encrypt backups and store them securely
6. **Network Security**: Use firewalls and network segmentation
7. **SSL/TLS**: Always use HTTPS in production
8. **Secret Management**: Use proper secret management systems

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user input
2. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
3. **Dependencies**: Regularly update and audit dependencies
4. **Code Review**: Implement mandatory security code reviews
5. **Testing**: Include security testing in your development process
6. **Documentation**: Document security considerations and requirements

### For Users

1. **Strong Passwords**: Use strong, unique passwords
2. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Enable 2FA when available
3. **Regular Updates**: Keep client applications updated
4. **Secure Networks**: Avoid using the system on public networks
5. **Report Issues**: Report any suspicious activities immediately
